# Improving Neural Network Training with Dimensionality Reduction Approach in the Context of Differential Privacy

# Prerequisites
Windows 11 + Intel Core i5-12600 + TensorFlow 2.5 with Docker Desktop
```
numpy
scikit-learn
tensorflow==2.5.0
tensorflow-privacy==0.1.0
umap-learn
```
# Future Plan
1. Quantifying the trade off relationship between time and accuracy performance
2. Switching to other DP algorithms to improve privacy mechanisms
3. Using larger datasets to observe performance under complex model bases
4. Use of other dimensionality reduction techniques
5. Adjustment of hyperparameters
